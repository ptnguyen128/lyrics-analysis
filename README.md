If you haven't, you'd need to install `gensim`, `nltk` and `lyricsgenius` by executing these commands  
`conda install -c conda-forge gensim`  
`run sudo pip install -U nltk`  
`pip install lyricsgenius`  

## How to
There are 2 Jupyter Notebooks in the Notebooks folder, `Lyrics Preprocessing.ipynb` will scrape the lyrics from Genius.com and preprocess the lyrics, and modeling is done in `Lyrics Analysis.ipynb`.
